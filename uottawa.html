</head>

<body>
	<p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The first case of this disease was detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China on the 31 December 2019. Later, on 11 March 2020 WHO declared this as a pandemic.</p>

	<p> People infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness. Older people, and those with other medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness and are at a greater risk.</p>

	<p>As a virus makes copies of itself it gets altered. These alterations often allow the virus to better adapt to its environment and become stronger. These changes are called "mutations" and are known as "variants" of the original virus. Some viruses mutate faster than others. However, SARS-CoV-2 changes slower compared to others such as Influenza. So far hundreds of variations of this virus have been identified.</p>
